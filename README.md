# reservation system

Description:

This is my project to practise Django and Python, meanwhile it was also great to work closer with HTML and Bootstrap.
Main idea: create a system where user could:
1) See whole accecable conference rooms
2) Book a room
3) Edit a room
4) Add a room
5) Search for a room
6) Set up a comment in reservation view and see previous reservations
7) Filter reservation dates

What I want to improve:

Currently implementing django-allauth for registration confirmation, and all auth logic.
At first i was using django generic views like generic login, generic signup, but i decided to use django-allauth library because it's really helpful with all it's authentication logic that i would have to write on my own every time.
1) Add admin panel
2) Add protected views

Requred versions described in requirement file.
